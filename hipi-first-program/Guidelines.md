If you are first time user of Hadoop and not have enough idea about Java development, this note could be useful to you.

When you run the first program, unlike Wordcount program, which has 3 individual files for Job, Mapper and Reducer, the code of this program contains only one program.
Mapper and Reducer classes are defined static so that can be be used within the same class as Job.
