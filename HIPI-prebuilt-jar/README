# HIPI-prebuilt-jar

This is the pre-built JAR file for Hadoop Image Processing Interface. 
When you download the files from official website of HIPI: http://hipi.cs.virginia.edu , it lacks some files, hence after building gradle,many of the developers may find errors while running hibImport and other commands. You have to add this jar file in your core/build/libs for successful execution.
