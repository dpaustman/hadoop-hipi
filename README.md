# HADOOP IMAGE PROCESSING INTERFACE (HIPI)

This is Hadoop Image Processing Interface (HIPI) repository. It is created with the aim of solving the difficulties faced by new HIPI users. 

I was going through the Google Group discussion of HIPI users and have found out that most of the queries regarding the problems were redundant. Since, the official website of HIPI does not provide all the information, we need help of other resources for complete installation and running programs. After finding here and there, and doing a lot of labor work to solve the issue, I realized that there is a need of a repository that can be useful as one stop solution of all the HIPI problems. So, I have created one. 

If you are also facing problems and finding solutions for the same, write the problem and solution of it here. Your contribution will be appreciated.

If you ever stuck somewhere, feel free to ask on ishit711@gmail.com
